My gut tells me this is an awful idea, but we'll see what happens! I'll

Why Bohrium? Bohrium's atomic number is 107 and as of me writing this
there are 107 days until March 20, 2020. That's when the next Animal
Crossing game comes out!

I give you this GUID: 3d44f38d-b0fd-48e0-8d7b-4de7b48326db

What does it mean? You'll just have to find out later!
